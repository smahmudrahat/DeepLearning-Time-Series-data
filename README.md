# DeepLearning-Time-Series-data
Applying different deeplearning architect in time series data
This project uses different deep learning architectures to forecast multiple time series datasets. In univariate time series datasets, general statistical forecasting shows better performances, but in terms of multivariate time series datasets, different deep-learning architects can outperform statistical learning models like the ARIMA model. In today's world, there are a lot of multivariate time series data generating spontaneously, like different health data in Fitbit or Apple watch, electrical consumption under a powerhouse, etc. So, the model should be independent of seasonality, trend, and cyclability so that it can track the data themselves. It will increase the scalability of the model for multiple time series data. The motivation behind this project is to apply different probabilistic-based deep learning models in the time series dataset. Time series datasets are suitable with statistical models like ARIMA and ELS, but its hindrance is on its scalability as it is needed to track the seasonality and trend manually.  Besides, researchers are currently trying to integrate solutions to different problems in deep learning. Deep learning is easy to integrate with other AI models in plug-in and using different prepared pre-trained models. It opens the hidden strength of the data. Because of the open-source models, pre-trained models, and other researchers prepared architecture, it is easier to evaluate the model and fine tune it according to the dimension of the problem. ![image](https://github.com/smahmudrahat/DeepLearning-Time-Series-data/assets/112737551/5dfd07c1-f5bc-4cfe-82fe-8cdf1f90c945)
